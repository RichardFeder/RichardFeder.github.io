<h2 class="post-title">About Me</h2>

Before Caltech, I completed my Bachelors in Physics and Astrophysics with Honors at Harvard University, where I worked with <a href="https://faun.rc.fas.harvard.edu/nebel/dfink//">Douglas Finkbeiner</a>. My research experiences in college helped foster my interest in applying novel statistical methods to extract the most information out of existing and near-future datasets. I am grateful for these opportunities as well as my for my very first research internship, for which I was mentored by <a href="https://francesca.civano.it/">Dr. Francesca Civano</a> at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.

I'm originally from Great Neck, New York. When I am not doing research, I enjoy playing music -- I currently play sax and clarinet in the Caltech jazz band and a number of other bands in Los Angeles.

  After several years on the west coast, my love the outdoors has inevitably grown stronger. I enjoy biking, hiking and camping.
