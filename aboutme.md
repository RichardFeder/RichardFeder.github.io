<h2 class="post-title">About Me</h2>
<p>
I am currently a rising sixth year PhD candidate in physics at Caltech, where I am supervised by Jamie Bock. I work on a number of data analysis projects, with a broad interest in developing and applying computational techniques rooted in astrostatistics maximize the information available from astronomical datasets.
<p>  
<!-- As a member of the CIBER collaboration, I have worked on both data analysis of CIBER-1 data and instrumentation work for the CIBER-2 experiment. During the first half of my PhD, I built hardware for CIBER-2, ran laboratory measurements to characterize detector performance, and worked through integration of the experiment with the full sounding rocket payload. This work was done in collaboration with NASA's sounding rocket program and involved working at NASA Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia and White Sands Missile Range in Las Cruces, New Mexico, where I participated in a successful first flight and experiment recovery (<a href ="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/rocket-team-to-discern-if-our-star-count-should-go-way-up">Press release for CIBER-2 first flight, June 2021</a>).

Before Caltech, I completed my Bachelors in Physics and Astrophysics with Honors at Harvard University, where I worked with <a href="https://faun.rc.fas.harvard.edu/nebel/dfink//">Douglas Finkbeiner</a>. My research experiences in college helped foster my interest in applying novel statistical methods to extract the most information out of existing and near-future datasets.

  I am originally from Great Neck, New York. When I am not doing research, I enjoy playing music -- I currently play sax and clarinet in the Caltech Jazz Band and a number of other bands in Los Angeles. I love the outdoors and enjoy both biking and hiking.
