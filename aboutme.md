<h2 class="post-title">About Me</h2>
<p>
I am currently a rising sixth year PhD candidate in physics at Caltech, where I am supervised by Jamie Bock. I work on a number of data analysis projects, with a broad interest in developing and applying computational techniques rooted in astrostatistics maximize the information available from astronomical datasets.
<p>  

Before Caltech, I completed my Bachelors in Physics and Astrophysics with Honors at Harvard University, where I worked with <a href="https://faun.rc.fas.harvard.edu/nebel/dfink//">Douglas Finkbeiner</a>. My research experiences in college helped foster my interest in applying novel statistical methods to extract the most information out of existing and near-future datasets.

  I am originally from Great Neck, New York. When I am not doing research, I enjoy playing music -- I currently play sax and clarinet in the Caltech Jazz Band and a number of other bands in Los Angeles. I love the outdoors and enjoy both biking and hiking.
