<h2 class="post-title">Dissecting the near-Infrared Universe with the Cosmic Infrared Background ExpeRiment (CIBER)</h2>
<p>
As a member of the CIBER collaboration, I have worked on both data analysis of CIBER-1 data and instrumentation work for the CIBER-2 experiment. During the first half of my PhD, I built hardware for CIBER-2, ran laboratory measurements to characterize detector performance, and worked through integration of the experiment with the full sounding rocket payload. This work was done in collaboration with NASA's sounding rocket program and involved working at NASA Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia and White Sands Missile Range in Las Cruces, New Mexico, where I participated in a successful first flight and experiment recovery (<a href ="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/rocket-team-to-discern-if-our-star-count-should-go-way-up">Press release for CIBER-2 first flight, June 2021</a>).
