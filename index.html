	Hi! As of September 2024 I am a postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="https://bccp.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics (BCCP)</a>, where I work with Prof. <a href="https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/uros-seljak">Uros Seljak</a> on probabilistic machine learning methods for cosmology. I completed my PhD in physics at Caltech in 2024, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/people/faculty/Jamie_Bock.html">Jamie Bock</a>.
	I am a member of the <a href="https://spherex.caltech.edu/">SPHEREx</a>, <a href="https://www.desi.lbl.gov/">DESI</a> and <a href="http://ciber.caltech.edu/">CIBER/CIBER-2</a> collaborations.  
	<br>
	<p>
	I work on a number of topics in observational cosmology. I am interested in the development and application of statistical methods that enhance studies of cosmic large-scale structure, using imaging from from galaxy surveys and intensity mapping datasets. 
	</p>
	<p>
	I also moonlight as a developer of the crowded field photometry technique "probabilistic cataloging", (PCAT for short, see <b>Projects</b> for more information).
