	Hi! I am currently a BCCP Postdoctoral Fellow at UC Berkeley/LBL. I completed my PhD in physics at Caltech in 2024, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/people/faculty/Jamie_Bock.html">Jamie Bock</a>. During my PhD I worked on data analysis and instrumentation for the <a href="https://ciberrocket.github.io/">Cosmic Infrared Background ExpeRiment (CIBER)</a>.
	I am a member of both the SPHEREx and CIBER collaborations. I work on a number of topics in observational cosmology.
	<br>
	<p>
	I am interested in the development and application of computational and statistical methods that enhance studies of cosmic large-scale structure, using imaging from from galaxy surveys and intensity mapping data. 
	</p>
	<p>
	I have moonlighted as a developer of the crowded field photometry tool "probabilistic cataloging", (PCAT for short). In particular I have extended the formalism to coherently model point-like and diffuse signals in astronomical images, which is publicly available in the code <a href="https://github.com/RichardFeder/pcat-de">PCAT-DE</a> (see <b>Projects</b> for more information).
