	Hi! I am currently a BCCP Postdoctoral Fellow at UC Berkeley/LBL, where I work with Prof. Uros Seljak on probabilistic machine learning methods for cosmology. I completed my PhD in physics at Caltech in 2024, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/people/faculty/Jamie_Bock.html">Jamie Bock</a>.
	I am a member of both the SPHEREx and CIBER collaborations.  
	<br>
	<p>
	I work on a number of topics in observational cosmology. I am interested in the development and application of statistical methods that enhance studies of cosmic large-scale structure, using imaging from from galaxy surveys and intensity mapping datasets. 
	</p>
	<p>
	I have moonlighted as a developer of the crowded field photometry tool "probabilistic cataloging", (PCAT for short). In particular I have extended the formalism to coherently model point-like and diffuse signals in astronomical images, which is publicly available in the code <a href="https://github.com/RichardFeder/pcat-de">PCAT-DE</a> (see <b>Projects</b> for more information).

	<br> In my free time, I am a musician (sax) and have played/recorded with a number of bands in Los Angeles. I love to hike and I love to bike!
