		Hi! As of September 2024 I am a postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="https://bccp.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics (BCCP)</a>, where I work with Prof. <a href="https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/uros-seljak">Uros Seljak</a> on probabilistic machine learning methods for cosmology. I completed my PhD in physics at Caltech in 2024, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/people/faculty/Jamie_Bock.html">Jamie Bock</a>.
		I am a member of the <a href="https://spherex.caltech.edu/">SPHEREx</a>, <a href="https://www.desi.lbl.gov/">DESI</a> and <a href="http://ciber.caltech.edu/">CIBER/CIBER-2</a> collaborations.  
		</p>
		<p>
		I work on a number of topics in observational cosmology. I am interested in the development and application of statistical methods that enhance studies of cosmic large-scale structure, using imaging/spectroscopy from galaxy surveys and intensity mapping datasets. 
		</p>
		<p>
		I also moonlight as a developer of the crowded field photometry technique "probabilistic cataloging", (PCAT for short, see <b>Projects</b> below for more information).

		<p>
		Before Caltech, I completed my Bachelors in Physics and Astrophysics with Honors at Harvard University, where I worked with <a href="https://faun.rc.fas.harvard.edu/nebel/dfink//">Douglas Finkbeiner</a>. My research experiences in college helped foster my interest in applying novel statistical methods to extract the most information out of existing and near-future datasets. I am grateful for these opportunities as well as my for my very first research internship, for which I was mentored by <a href="https://francesca.civano.it/">Dr. Francesca Civano</a> at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.
		</p>
		<p>
		I'm originally from Great Neck, New York. When I am not doing research, I enjoy playing music -- I play sax, clarinet and flute through a number of bands.
		</p>
		<p>
		After several years on the west coast, my love the outdoors has inevitably grown stronger. I enjoy biking, hiking and camping.

		<h3 class="post-title">Dissecting the near-Infrared Universe with the Cosmic Infrared Background ExpeRiment (CIBER)</h3>
		<p>
		CIBER is a sounding rocket experiment designed to characterize the near-infrared EBL through measurement of fluctuation anisotropies and low-resolution spectroscopy. As a member of the CIBER, I have worked on both data analysis of CIBER-1 data and instrumentation work for its successor CIBER-2. During the first half of my PhD, I built hardware for CIBER-2, ran laboratory measurements to characterize detector performance, and worked through integration of the experiment with the full sounding rocket payload. This work was done in collaboration with NASA's sounding rocket program and involved working at NASA Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia and White Sands Missile Range in Las Cruces, New Mexico, where I participated in a successful first flight and experiment recovery (<a href ="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/rocket-team-to-discern-if-our-star-count-should-go-way-up">Press release for CIBER-2 first flight, June 2021</a>).

		For my dissertation project I am leading a fluctuation analysis of CIBER-1 fourth flight imaging data. Broad band, near infrared intensity mapping has great potential to shed light on interpretations of the extragalactic background light (EBL), which contains the integrated emission from all sources along each line of sight. Through multi- wavelength measurement of large-angle (several arcminute to degree scale) surface brightness fluctuations, we can interpret the relative amplitudes of astrophysical components that comprise the EBL through spatial and spectral cross-correlations. I am also interested in characterizing the intensity bias of NIR fluctuations correlated against galaxy surveys of large-scale structure.

		<h3 class="post-title">SPHEREx</h3>
		<p>
		The Spectrophotometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx) is NASA's next MIDEX mission with a current expected launch date in early 2025. Through the same detector and linear variable filter (LVF) technology used by CIBER, SPHEREx will conduct an all sky spectral survey in 102 bands between 0.75-5 micron, producing a low-resolution spectrum for every 6 x 6 arcsecond line of sight on the sky. The nominal two-year survey will revolutionize studies of NIR intensity mapping through a huge jump in coverage and increased sensitivity. 
		</p>
		<p>
		I am also a member of the <a href="https://spherex.caltech.edu/">SPHEREx</a> cosmology team, for which I have developed realistic galaxy SED simulations and synthetic SPHEREx spectrophotometry through the tool <i>CLIPonSS</i> (Conditional LIne Painting on Synthetic Spectra). We are using these simulations to test redshift recovery for the SPHEREx cosmology sample, which will require hundreds of millions of accurate redshifts to constrain the primordial non-Gaussianity parameter fNL through the scale-dependent bias. I am interested in applying new methodologies to improve SED modeling and redshift estimates for these and other spectrophotometric samples.

		<p>
		I am also a developer of the Bayesian, transdimensional forward modeling approach "probabilistic cataloging" (PCAT for short). Starting from work applying multi-band probabilistic cataloging to SDSS images for my college senior thesis, I later extended the methodology during my PhD to coherently model point-like and diffuse signals in astronomical images, leading to a measurement of the ICM temperature for galaxy cluster RXJ 1347 through the thermal and relativistic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac6c04">Butler+Feder 2022</a>) and the publication of the code PCAT-DE, with documentation available <a href="https://pcat-de.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">here</a> and implementation detailed in <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ace69b">Feder et al. 2023</a>. The code is flexible and has been made available for use by the broader astronomy community.

		<h3 class="post-title">The Universe SPHEREx Will See: Empirically Based Galaxy Simulations and Redshift Predictions</h3>
		<p>
		We simulate galaxy properties and redshift estimation for SPHEREx, the next NASA Medium Class Explorer. To make robust models of the galaxy population and test spectro-photometric redshift performance for SPHEREx, we develop a set of synthetic spectral energy distributions based on detailed fits to COSMOS2020 photometry spanning 0.1-8 micron. Given that SPHEREx obtains low-resolution spectra, emission lines will be important for some fraction of galaxies. Here we expand on previous work, using better photometry and photometric redshifts from COSMOS2020, and tight empirical relations to predict robust emission line strengths and ratios. A second galaxy catalog derived from the GAMA survey is generated to ensure the bright (mAB&lt;18 in the i-band) sample is representative over larger areas. Using template fitting to estimate photometric continuum redshifts, we forecast redshift recovery of 19 million galaxies over 30000 sq. deg. with σz&lt;0.003(1+z), 445 million with σz&lt;0.1(1+z) and 810 million with σz&lt;0.2(1+z). We also find through idealized tests that emission line information from spectrally dithered flux measurements can yield redshifts with accuracy beyond that implied by the naive SPHEREx channel resolution, motivating the development of a hybrid continuum-line redshift estimation approach.

		<h3 class="post-title">PCAT-DE: Reconstructing Pointlike and Diffuse Signals in Astronomical Images Using Spatial and Spectral Information</h3>
		<p>Accepted to AJ, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ace69b">link here</a>.</p>
		<p>
		Abstract: Observational data from astronomical imaging surveys contain information about a variety of source populations and environments, and their complexity will increase substantially as telescopes become more sensitive. Even for existing observations, measuring the correlations between pointlike and diffuse emission can be crucial to correctly inferring the properties of any individual component. For this task, information is typically lost, because of conservative data cuts, aggressive filtering, or incomplete treatment of contaminated data. We present the code PCAT-DE, an extension of probabilistic cataloging, designed to simultaneously model pointlike and diffuse signals. This work incorporates both explicit spatial templates and a set of nonparametric Fourier component templates into a forward model of astronomical images, reducing the number of processing steps applied to the observed data. Using synthetic Herschel-SPIRE multiband observations, we demonstrate that point-source and diffuse emission can be reliably separated and measured. We present two applications of this model. For the first, we perform point-source detection/photometry in the presence of galactic cirrus and demonstrate that cosmic infrared background galaxy counts can be recovered in cases of significant contamination. In the second, we show that the spatially extended thermal Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect signal can be reliably measured even when it is subdominant to the pointlike emission from individual galaxies.

		<h3 class="post-title">Measurement of the Relativistic Sunyaev–Zeldovich Correction in RX J1347.5-1145</h3>
		<p>Co-led with Victoria Butler, Accepted to AJ, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac6c04">link here</a>.</p>
		<p>
		Abstract: We present a measurement of the relativistic corrections to the thermal Sunyaev–Zel'dovich (SZ) effect spectrum, the rSZ effect, toward the massive galaxy cluster RX J1347.5-1145 by combining submillimeter images from Herschel-SPIRE with millimeter wavelength Bolocam maps. Our analysis simultaneously models the SZ effect signal, the population of cosmic infrared background galaxies, and the galactic cirrus dust emission in a manner that fully accounts for their spatial and frequency-dependent correlations. Gravitational lensing of background galaxies by RX J1347.5-1145 is included in our methodology based on a mass model derived from the Hubble Space Telescope observations. Utilizing a set of realistic mock observations, we employ a forward modeling approach that accounts for the non-Gaussian covariances between the observed astrophysical components to determine the posterior distribution of SZ effect brightness values consistent with the observed data. We determine a maximum a posteriori (MAP) value of the average Comptonization parameter of the intracluster medium (ICM) within R2500 to be 〈y〉2500 = 1.56 × 10−4, with corresponding 68% credible interval [1.42, 1.63] × 10−4, and a MAP ICM electron temperature of 〈Tsz〉2500 = 22.4 keV with 68% credible interval spanning [10.4, 33.0] keV. This is in good agreement with the pressure-weighted temperature obtained from Chandra X-ray observations, 〈Tx,pw〉2500 = 17.4 ± 2.3 keV. We aim to apply this methodology to comparable existing data for a sample of 39 galaxy clusters, with an estimated uncertainty on the ensemble mean 〈Tsz〉2500 at the ≃ 1 keV level, sufficiently precise to probe ICM physics and to inform X-ray temperature calibration.

		<h3 class="post-title">Non-linear 3D Cosmic Web Simulation with Heavy-Tailed Generative Adversarial Networks</h3>
		<p>In collaboration with <a href="https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/PBerger/">Philippe Berger</a> and <a href="https://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~gstein/">George Stein</a>. Accepted to Physical Review D, arXiv link <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03050">here</a>.</p>

		Many inference problems in cosmology incorporate information from simulations when making comparisons to observational data. Comparing data to simulations (e.g., N-body, hydrodynamical, etc.) can be challenging when the data are high-dimensional and when generating the simulations is computationally expensive. Some summary statistics can be analytically derived (the power spectrum being one example), but for higher order statistics and covariances these analytical prescriptions often have limitations. I am interested in the ways deep generative modeling can be used to bridge the gap between expensive simulations and robust cosmological inference.
		</p>
		<p>
		My collaborators and I investigated how well generative adversarial networks (GANs) could emulate evolved dark matter density fields trained on ensembles of N-body simulations. Deep learning methods excel at modeling non-linear data, so by emulating directly to the data space, summary statistics like the power spectrum and bispectrum can be predicted well into the small-scale, non-linear regime where analytic methods fail but where there is often more constraining power. In addition to reproducing the two- and three-point statistics of GADGET dark matter simulations (and their covariances), we demonstrated the capability for these models to interpolate in redshift space. Work by others following this publication has extended this deep generative modeling approach to interpolate cosmological parameters and model other fields such as those from hydrodynamical simulations.

		<h3 class="post-title">Multi-band Probabilistic Cataloging: A Joint Fitting Approach to Point-source Detection and Deblending</h3>
		<p><b>Supervised by <a href="https://faun.rc.fas.harvard.edu/nebel/dfink//">Douglas Finkbeiner</a>, in collaboration with <a href="http://portillo.ca/">Stephen Portillo</a> and <a href="tansudaylan.com">Tansu Daylan</a></b></p>
		<p>
		Abstract: Probabilistic cataloging (PCAT) outperforms traditional cataloging methods on single-band optical data in crowded fields. We extend our work to multiple bands, achieving greater sensitivity (∼0.4 mag) and greater speed (500×) compared to previous single-band results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of multiband PCAT on mock data, in terms of both recovering accurate posteriors in the catalog space and directly deblending sources. When applied to Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) observations of M2, taking Hubble Space Telescope data as truth, our joint fit on r- and i-band data goes ∼0.4 mag deeper than single-band probabilistic cataloging and has a false discovery rate less than 20% for F606W ≤ 20. Compared to DAOPHOT, the two-band SDSS catalog fit goes nearly 1.5 mag deeper using the same data and maintains a lower false discovery rate down to F606W ∼ 20.5. Given recent improvements in computational speed, multiband PCAT shows promise in application to large-scale surveys and is a plausible framework for joint analysis of multi-instrument observational data. https://github.com/RichardFeder/multiband_pcat.
