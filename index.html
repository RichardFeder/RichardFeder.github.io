	Hello! I am a final year physics graduate student at Caltech, where I work under the supervision of <a href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/people/faculty/Jamie_Bock.html">Jamie Bock</a>. Prior to my
	time at Caltech I was an undergraduate student at Harvard University, where I worked with Douglas Finkbeiner and completed my BA in Physics
	and Astrophysics with Honors. 
	<br>
	<p>
	My research interests lie in the development and use of computational and statistical methods to enhance studies of large scale structure, using information from galaxy surveys and intensity maps. During my PhD I have worked on both data analysis and instrumentation for the <a href="https://ciberrocket.github.io/">Cosmic Infrared Background ExpeRiment (CIBER)</a>. I am also a member of the <a href="https://spherex.caltech.edu/">SPHEREx</a> cosmology team, for which I have developed realistic galaxy SED simulations and synthetic SPHEREx spectrophotometry to test various redshift estimation methods. 
	</p>
	<p>
	I am also a developer of the Bayesian forward modeling approach "probabilistic cataloging", or PCAT for short. Starting from work applying multi-band probabilistic cataloging to SDSS images for my college senior thesis, I later extended the methodology during my PhD to coherently model point-like and diffuse signals in astronomical images, leading to a measurement of the ICM temperature for galaxy cluster RXJ 1347 through the thermal and relativistic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac6c04">Butler+Feder 2022</a>) and the publication of the code PCAT-DE, with documentation available <a href="https://pcat-de.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">here</a> and implementation detailed in <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ace69b">Feder et al. 2023</a>. The code is flexible and has been made available for use by the broader astronomy community.
